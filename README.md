## Problem Statement

A new film company, ‚ÄúSeventeen‚Äù just got a capital from the stakeholder and planning to release a movie that can achieve high box office numbers and maximise its profits for capital return. The studio is willing to invest $100 million on a new summer box office hit. To solve this problem we would like to see what kind of movie the company should invest in and what kind of parameters that influence a movie's success.

Disclaimer: 
For this project we will only use and process the data from 2000-2016, because our project is expected for a 2028 release so we only examine the statictics from those years as consumer spending behaviour and movie's watcher behaviour tends to change over the decade(Waiping, Ng. 2022).
